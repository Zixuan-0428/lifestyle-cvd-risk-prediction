        "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the main reasons of death worldwide, but many cases can be avoided through better lifestyle choices and early prevention.Our project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of CVD based only on demographic and lifestyle data such as age, gender, smoking, drinking, and physical activity.We want to see how far simple data can go in identifying high-risk individuals—without using any medical or lab test information. This helps us understand whether behavioral data alone can provide enough insight for prevention programs, especially in places with limited resources."

Because BRFSS relies on self-reported data, responses may include non-responses, skip patterns, or coded values such as “Don’t know” or “Refused.” To ensure data quality and analytical feasibility, we selected a subset of variables most relevant to cardiovascular disease prediction—covering demographics, lifestyle behaviors, chronic conditions, and access to care—and removed variables with excessive missingness or irrelevant clinical content. We also applied random sampling to reduce the dataset to 100,000 records for computational efficiency while preserving the overall structure and representativeness of the population."

        "Why We Transform Certain Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "Some variables are stored as numbers but represent categories (e.g., 1=Yes, 2=No, 7/9=Don’t know). Others mix real numeric values with special numeric codes (e.g., 1–30 days vs. 77/99 for invalid responses). To avoid misleading the model, we transform each type separately: categorical-coded numbers are recoded and treated as categories, while mixed numeric variables have special codes mapped to meaningful values or NaN. This ensures all variables reflect their true meaning before modeling.\n"

        "Logistic Regression performs moderately well in our lifestyle-only dataset and provides the clearest insight into how individual features shift CVD risk, since each coefficient directly reflects direction and strength of association. This interpretability is a major advantage, allowing us to identify which demographic or behavioral categories increase disease likelihood, but its linear structure also makes it less capable of capturing nonlinear thresholds or interaction effects that likely exist in health-behavior patterns. As a result, its recall is reasonable but not optimal, making the model valuable for interpretation rather than peak predictive performance."

        "KNN performs poorly in this task, with recall barely above random, because distance-based learning breaks down under high-dimensional one-hot encoded categorical inputs. Although the model is simple, requires no distribution assumptions, and could theoretically discover proximity-based behavioral clusters, in practice the feature space here is sparse and categorical rather than continuous—making similarity meaningless and causing the classifier to generalize very weakly. This highlights that KNN is not suitable for lifestyle-based CVD prediction in its current data form."

        "The Decision Tree achieves strong recall and successfully captures nonlinear splits, suggesting that CVD risk is influenced by threshold-type behavior changes rather than smooth gradients. A single tree offers transparent rules that are easy to interpret and show meaningful interaction effects, yet this structure can also be unstable and prone to overfitting if not controlled. With tuning (max_depth=4, balanced class weight), the tree performs well without growing overly complex, balancing interpretability and performance—but its stability still cannot match ensemble methods."

        "Random Forest delivers consistently high recall and generalizes better than a single tree by averaging across many decision paths, reducing variance and noise-sensitivity. This makes it one of the best performing models in our setting, and the feature importance scores give a reliable view of which behavioral variables the model prioritizes. However, the trade-off is reduced interpretability—unlike logistic regression or a single tree, we lose clear directionality and individual decision logic. Still, Random Forest stands out as a strong predictive model when using only behavior-based features."

        "Despite being powerful in many machine-learning tasks, XGBoost performs poorly here—the recall remains low even after parameter tuning, indicating that boosting does not extract strong incremental signal from categorical lifestyle data. While the model excels at capturing complex nonlinear interactions when continuous clinical measures exist, the one-hot-encoded patterns used in this project offer limited structured gradients for boosting to exploit. This suggests XGBoost would likely improve only if richer numeric medical indicators or temporal health traces were included."

        "Using lifestyle and demographic data from BRFSS, we successfully predicted heart-disease risk without relying on clinical measurements. Among all models, Decision Tree and Random Forest delivered the highest performance, achieving recall values around 0.77–0.79, far outperforming KNN and XGBoost.\n",
        "\n",
        "These tree-based models excel because they naturally capture nonlinear patterns, threshold effects, and interactions in categorical survey data, while class-weight balancing allows them to better identify the minority positive class. Random Forest improves stability through ensemble averaging, while Decision Tree remains highly interpretable with comparable recall.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, our findings show that behavioral and demographic information alone can meaningfully detect high-risk individuals, demonstrating the value of low-cost, survey-based early-risk prediction for public-health applications."

        "To overcome these constraints, future work should expand beyond binary lifestyle indicators and capture richer behavioral depth — not just whether someone smokes or exercises, but how intensely, how consistently, and for how long. Variables such as pack-year smoking exposure, sleep regularity metrics, and validated diet quality indices could uncover gradations of risk currently invisible to the model. Additionally, psychological and social context is likely a key mediator between lifestyle and disease progression; mental-health–linked measures such as stress burden, depressive symptoms, loneliness, and social support could introduce a missing dimension of risk. Beyond the individual, cardiovascular health is shaped by environment: air quality, green-space access, food environment, and walkability all influence long-term behavior and inflammation. Integrating environmental and contextual indicators may allow us to build models that better reflect real-world health determinants, ultimately improving recall–precision balance and strengthening the credibility of predictions in preventive medicine."

        "Despite achieving a stable AUC of approximately 0.83 across multiple algorithms, the predictive ceiling remains difficult to break. Even when we introduce more advanced methods such as Voting and Stacking, performance does not meaningfully exceed Logistic Regression, suggesting that additional algorithmic complexity does not unlock new signal in the current dataset. This also implies that the underlying behavioral variables may carry limited non-linear structure, restricting the room for incremental predictive gain. Furthermore, model interpretability remains a critical drawback — while logistic regression provides coefficients, its explanatory power weakens once interactions and encoded variables multiply, reducing clinical trust and decision transparency. When we increase recall to capture more potential at-risk individuals, false positives rise simultaneously, pushing precision downward and making threshold-setting clinically sensitive. Overall, the plateaued performance indicates that behavioral data alone may not fully capture the physiological mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, which caps the model’s ultimate diagnostic reliability.\n",
